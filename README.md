### This is belong to final year project of my study program at HUST
### GAN-MF (Generative Adversarial Network for Matrix Factorization)
GAN-MF is an implementation of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for Matrix Factorization. It is a novel approach to collaborative filtering that leverages the power of GANs to learn informative representations of user-item interactions for recommendation.

### How GAN-MF Works
GAN-MF consists of two main components: the generator and the discriminator. The generator takes as input user embeddings and generates item embeddings, while the discriminator tries to distinguish between real item embeddings from the training data and fake item embeddings generated by the generator. The generator and discriminator are trained adversarially, where the generator tries to fool the discriminator, and the discriminator tries to correctly classify real and fake item embeddings.

## Requirements:
    matplotlib==3.0.2
    numpy==1.16.2
    pandas==0.24.1
    seaborn==0.9.0
    tensorflow==2.12.0
    tqdm==4.31.1
### Usage:
    Clone this repository.
    Install the required dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.
    Run the main.py script to start training the GAN-MF model on the dataset and change the config in file main.py if you like to see others results
    The GANMF.py is the GANMF model with using Autoencoders for generator and the GAN_not_autoencoders.py is GANMF model without using Autoencoders. Change the code in line 46 to run each models
